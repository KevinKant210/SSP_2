to compile open up your preffered terminal,
you can run gcc -v to check that you have gcc in your terminal.
if an unrecognized command please install the gcc compiler.

with gcc installed you can install lex.c along with any input file you intend to run.
put these both in the same folder, if not in the same folder the program will not find the file.
once in the same folder open up your preffered terminal within the folder.
run the command gcc lex.c to compile the program.

If using a linux based terminal run the line: ./a.out "filename.txt".
If using the command prompt you can simply run the line: a "filename.txt".

ofcourse replacing "filename.txt" with the name of your input file.
The results of the file should print to your command line given correct input and no errors.

If using another terminal please find out how to run a c program using google.
